# Borrowed from Wi-Fi Scan Example

The ESP-IDF code from Espressif is under the Apache 2.0 license.
The code in this repo (esp32_publications) is also under the Apache 2.0 license.

(See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.)

The example scan code was the basis for the scan project. However, the use of sleep-mode, interrupts,
battery, the wake-button and the LED outputs were all added.
